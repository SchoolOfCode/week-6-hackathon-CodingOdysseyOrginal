# Break into the captions office 

The Space Captain has encrypted a secret message by reversing each word, and your mission is to decode it. Your task is to reverse the letters in each word back to their original form, while maintaining the word order.

# Instructions:


If the input is an array, throw an error with the message "Input must be a string, not an array."

Reverse the letters of each word in the string, while preserving the order of the words.

Return the decoded message as a string, where each word is decoded (the letters are reversed back), but the word order remains the same.

# Example 

captainsCode("eviL gnol dna repsorp")
// Expected output: "Live long and prosper"
